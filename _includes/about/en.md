Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my blog!

My name is Yingjie Xiao, and I am studying Computational Linguistics at the University of TÃ¼bingen. My academic interests lie primarily in analyzing linguistic nuances with computational methods.

In this blog, I will share my thoughts on my reading and studies. You will find reflections on academic papers, book reviews, and my experiences with programming languages and computational linguistics methods. Additionally, I may occasionally write about my personal experiences as an international student in Germany.
